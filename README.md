To open application just run server.py.
It will open web app on local host.
Have fun and report bugs to my email: dawidjedraszczyk01@gmail.com


Bugs that i know and im working on it:
1. some buses didnt show on map, because routing machine cant find way between them,
2. on first start 'rozklad jazdy' button probably will not work, just restart website without restarting server,
3. mess with responsibility, first on todo list!
4. buses with letters on name will not work, because they are not on python algoritm (i had got troubles with scrapping data when the letter was in bus number).
