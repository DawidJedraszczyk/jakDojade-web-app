To open application just run server.py.
It will open web app on local host.
If you want check how does it work, just write some letter into input, it will autosuggest you names of stops.
You can also check bus routes, there you can check departure hours of bus on every bus stop.
Have fun and report bugs to my email: dawidjedraszczyk01@gmail.com


Bugs that i know and im working on it:
1. some buses didnt show on map, because routing machine cant find way between them,
2. on first start buttons probably will not work, just restart website without restarting server (fixed?),
3. buses with letters on name will not work, because they are not on python algoritm (i had got troubles with scrapping data when the letter was in bus number).
